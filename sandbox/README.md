# Sandbox 

This is the sandbox for scripts and testing files. The folder is divided in three folders:

* [1_data_processing](https://github.com/angelofgdsantos/cow_market_power/tree/main/sandbox/1_data_processing): Contains codes for data processing.
* [2_visualization](https://github.com/angelofgdsantos/cow_market_power/tree/main/sandbox/2_visualization): Contains codes for data visualization.
* [3_analysis](https://github.com/angelofgdsantos/cow_market_power/tree/main/sandbox/3_analysis): Contains codes for data scalability.


All the scripts have an uniformed structure that aims to ensure consistency and ease of understanding. Each script includes a header with the following information:

- **Author**: The name of the person who wrote the script.
- **Date**: The date when the script was created or last modified.
- **Description**: A brief description of what the script does.
- **Usage**: Instructions on how to run the script, including any command-line arguments or parameters that need to be specified.
- **Input**: The input data required by the script.
- **Output**: The output data generated by the script.

This structure is found in :

- For python : **[python_base_script.py](https://github.com/angelofgdsantos/cow_market_power/tree/main/sandbox/python_base_script.py)**.
- For stata : **[stata_base_script.do](https://github.com/angelofgdsantos/cow_market_power/tree/main/sandbox/stata_base_script.do)**.
